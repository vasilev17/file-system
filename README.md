<h1>üíæüìÅ File System ‚Äî File & Directory Manager</h1>
  
<p>This project is a single file virtual file system implemented in C#. It stores an entire directory tree plus file contents in one backing file <code>fileSystem.txt</code> and exposes a mini shell with Unix-like commands for interaction.</p>

## üì¶ Features

- **Single-File Persistence** ‚Äì The entire virtual file-system tree, including directories, file metadata and raw contents is serialised into one human-readable backing file (fileSystem.txt), keeping the project self-contained and easy to reset or share.

- **Mini Shell** ‚Äì Built-in commands (mkdir, ls, cd, write, cat, cp, import, export, exit, ‚Ä¶) give a Unix-like workflow without leaving the program.

- **Cross-Platform & Zero-Dependency** ‚Äì Targets .NET 5+ and needs nothing beyond the standard runtime, so it runs the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Session Durability** ‚Äì The working directory and files survive application restarts.

- **Real OS and Virtual FS Bridging** ‚Äì Import and export commands let the user copy files back and forth between the real OS and the simulated FS.

- **Path-Safe Navigation** ‚Äì Internally normalises and validates paths to keep the user from escaping above the virtual root, protecting the host machine.

- **Easy to Expand** ‚Äì Commands are implemented with a simple switch dispatcher; adding new operations (e.g., rm, move, find) is straightforward.
